![feature](https://github.com/JasonLandis/JasonLandis/assets/100310833/24b62e2f-0325-4f9d-8df4-e654c40c758a)

## How to play
In Constellation, you play as a star within a universe surrounded by other stars. You have a mini-map that allows you to see where you are in the universe and any stars that are close by. You select a direction and a distance to begin traveling and grow your constellation.

## Asteroids
While traveling, you must avoid oncoming asteroids. Asteroids have three attributes: size, spread, and speed. Also, each universe has 5 zones; you start in zone 1, and each time you enter a higher zone, the size, spread, and speed of the asteroids change to increase the difficulty of the game.

## Roguelike
If you land on another star in the universe, you are randomly given a choice to potentially alter the size, spread, or speed of the asteroids to make the game easier. You may also be given the choice to claim some extra lives. If you manage to clear Zone 5, you exit the universe, your scores are saved, and you can travel to another universe.

## Unlockables
There are many different stars to unlock, each bringing a unique glow to your game. There are also many upgrades to unlock, allowing you to choose the starting value of the size, spread, and speed of the asteroids, as well as how many extra lives you start with.
