## Games I'm working on using Unity:

1. Pathfinder (2D puzzle game)
2. Constellation (2D scrolling game)

## Future project ideas:

#### 1. Rubik's Cube designer

This will be a website where people can create their own rubik's cube designs with ease. I have made a few of my own multiple solution Rubik's Cube designs. Here's some of my designs.
