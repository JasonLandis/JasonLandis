## Games I'm working on using Unity:

1. Pathfinder (2D puzzle game)
2. Constellation (2D scrolling game)

## Future project ideas:

#### 1. Rubik's Cube designer

This will be a website where people can create their own rubik's cube designs with ease. I'm interested in designs with potentially multiple solutions. Here's a few I've come up with.
