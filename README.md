# Hey there,

## Games on working on using Unity:

1. Pathfinder (2D puzzle game)
2. Constellation (2D scrolling game)

Checkout my repositories for more information!

## Future project ideas:

#### 1. Rubik's Cube designer

This will be a website where people can create their own rubik's cube designs with ease. I have made a few of my own multiple solution Rubik's Cube designs. My profile picture is a pixel-art depiction of one I made called the circuit cube with 3 distinct solutions.

#### 2. Discord music bot for youtube

I want to make my own discord music bot that only works through playing youtube audio.
